Reporting issues
================

If you are using igraph from R and you are not absolutely sure that the root cause
of the issue lies in the C layer, submit your issue in the igraph/rigraph project
instead.

If you are using igraph from Python and you are not absolutely sure that the
root cause of the issue lies in the C layer, submit your issue in the
igraph/python-igraph project instead.

If you do not have a bug or feature request but you only need help with using
igraph, send your question to the igraph-help mailing list instead at
igraph-help@nongnu.org.
